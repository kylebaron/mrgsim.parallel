# Introduction 

File streams are objects you can create to help in organizing larger simulations
which are naturally broken in to a series of smaller simulations. One example
is a set of replicate simulations which are performed as a part of 
simulation-based model checking. Another example would be a large number of 
doses which need to be evaluated in a population context. In this case, 
one _very_ large data set is assembled and then broken into `chunks` to be 
simulated in parallel. In both cases, it is assumed that the outputs (and maybe
the inputs) are very large and would benefit from an extra layer of 
organization, including a consideration of how the simulations are stored on 
disk and accessed at a later time.

The emphasis in these use cases is better management of very large simulation
outputs. However, given this is a package vignette, we will illustrate the 
setup and implementation with problems of a (much) smaller scale. 


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = '.')
has_arrow <- requireNamespace("arrow")
```

# File stream basics


```{r, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(mrgsim.parallel)
```

In the simplest use case, we might want to simulate some large number of 
replicates. We can start to manage this simulation by creating a file 
stream

```{r}
x <- new_stream(10)
```

This creates a file stream, which is just a list with one position representing
each replicate that we want to do

```{r}
length(x)
```

Each slot holds another list containing information for the `ith` replicate. 
Looking at replicate 5 we have

```{r}
x[[5]]
```

There are three named positions

1. `i` the replicate number
1. `file` the stem of the output file for this replicate
1. `x` the data payload for this replicate; in this case it is just `i`

The stem of the output file is named with the current replicate number (`05`) 
and the total number of replicates in the set (`10`).  The file stem will always 
be configured to have the format `n` of `N`; but can be customized with a 
prefix or to use a different separator character (see below).

If we had a model and data set to be simulated in replicate

```{r}
mod <- house(rtol = 1e-4, outvars = "DV")

data <- expand.ev(amt = 100, ID = 10)
```

we could use the file stream object to structure the simulation

```{r}
out <- lapply(x, function(fs) {
  mrgsim(mod, data) %>% mutate(i = fs$i)
}) %>% bind_rows()
```

We have used the replicate number (`fs$i`) to tag the output of the simulation.
This is a simple example to get started on the basic idea. We could have easily
done the same simulation by calling

```{r, eval = FALSE}
out <- lapply(1:10, function(i) {
  mrgsim(mod, data) %>% mutate(i = i)
}) %>% bind_rows()
```
It would give identical results and using the file stream would have been 
overkill. So let's use the file stream object to help us save these simulations
to a file in an efficient and organized way. 

# Use file stream to create a data set on disk

To do this we'll add two arguments to the call to `new_stream()`

1. `locker` a directory that is reserved for this set of simulation output (only)
1. `format` the output format for saving the files

```{r, include = FALSE}
locker <- file.path(tempdir(), "replicate1")
if(dir.exists(locker)) unlink(locker, recursive = TRUE)
```


```{r}
locker <- file.path(tempdir(), "replicate1")

x <- new_stream(10, locker = locker, format = "fst")
```

Since this is a package vignette, we are saving the outputs to `tempdir()`, not
something that we'd recommend in production work, where simulations should
be saved locally. We also specified `format` to be `fst`, which uses the package
of the same name to save the data in an efficient format.

Now let's look at the object for the 5th replicate

```{r}
x[[5]]
```

We still have `i` (the replicate number). But now `file` is populated with 
a complete path to the output file. What can't be seen here is that 
the `replicate` directory has been created

```{r}
dir.exists(dirname(x[[5]]$file))
```
When the file stream was created, so was the directory where the files would
be saved. Details about the storage `locker` are provided below.

Also notice that the object has a new attribute

```{r}
class(x[[5]])
```

This indicates that the file 
```{r}
basename(x[[5]]$file)
```

will be saved in `fst` format when the time comes. `fst` a very efficient format
for storing data frames in R; but you can choose other formats, like `feather`
(also for data frames) or `qs` or `rds` for saving any R object. 

To save the `ith` replicate to its pre-defined file location, we call the 
function `write_stream()` inside our simulation loop

```{r}
out <- lapply(x, function(fs) {
  ans <- mrgsim(mod, data) %>% mutate(i = fs$i)
  write_stream(fs, ans)
  return(fs$file)
})
```

Notice in the previous that we didn't return the data; that's part of the 
strategy where we write the data to disk rather than return a potentially 
massive amount of data that could easily swamp our R session. But we did return 
the `location` of each file that we wrote out

```{r}
out[1:3]
```

This makes it easy to read the data back in 

```{r, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(fst)
sims <- lapply(out, read_fst) 
head(sims[[8]])
```


`mrgsim.parallel` provides a helper function for reading in a set 
of `fst` files

```{r}
sims <- internalize_fst(locker)
str(sims)
```

By default, `internalize_fst` returns a single data frame with all 
of your simulations. You can also run a head of the file set

```{r}
head_fst(locker, n = 8)
```

Or get a list of the files
```{r}
fst <- list_fst(locker)
fst[2]
```



# Alternate (better) file formats

`fst` is an excellent file format and very fast to read and write. But notice
with the `internalize_fst()` call, we are still reading in all the data back 
into the R session. We don't _have_ to do that; we could have just read 
the first 5 files

```{r}
sims <- list_fst(locker)[1:5] %>% lapply(read_fst) %>% bind_rows()
```

But we want better value for the price that was paid to write the outputs
to disk. 

This is where the `arrow` package comes in. Apache Arrow is "a cross-language
development platform for in-memory data."  Basically, you can have a 
huge amount of data on disk in an arrow data set and work with it as if 
it is loaded in memory. 

The following examples will only be run if the arrow package is installed 
when this vignette is built. 

First, re-create the file stream with format `feather`

```{r, eval = has_arrow}
x <- new_stream(10, format = "feather", locker = locker)
```

Now, the files are ready to be stored in feather format

```{r, eval = has_arrow}
basename(x[[5]]$file)
class(x[[5]])
```

and when we re-run the simulation, we'll have a set of `feather` files
rather than `fst` files

```{r, eval = has_arrow}
out <- lapply(x, function(fs) {
  ans <- mrgsim(mod, data) %>% mutate(i = fs$i)
  write_stream(fs, ans)
  return(fs$file)
})
```
Notice that there is no change to the simulation code; we still call 
`write_stream()` and because `fs[[i]]` is set up with `feather` output, 
we get that method when writing.

Now we don't need a helper function to read the files; we'll use 
`arrow::open_dataset()` 

```{r, eval = has_arrow, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(arrow)

ds <- arrow::open_dataset(locker, format = "feather")
```

This `ds` object is a pointer to the data; it hasn't actually been loaded
but we can take a peek at it

```{r, eval = has_arrow}
head(ds)
```


Once we have the data set open, we can `filter` and `select` the rows 
and columns that we want, and then call `as_tibble()` to collect the results

```{r, eval = has_arrow}
sims <- filter(ds, time > 12, i < 5) %>% as_tibble()
```

Now we have only the part of the simulated data that we need to work with 
right now

```{r, eval = has_arrow}
head(sims)
dim(sims)
```

# Manipulating file streams

In the most basic example, we created a file stream like this

```{r}
x <- new_stream(10)
```

Once the file stream is created, we can indicate the output format after the 
fact

```{r}
x <- format_stream(x, "fst")
```

This will put the proper class on the `file_stream` object and set the 
file extension

```{r}
x[[3]]$file
class(x[[3]])
```

There are also functions for adding an output file path

```{r}
x <- locate_stream(x, locker)
x[[2]]$file
```

`locate_stream()` comes with an argument called `initialize` which can be used
to initialize the locker space if it hasn't already been initialized or reset.

Finally, you can  manipulate the file extension
```{r}
x <- ext_stream(x, "")
x[[4]]$file
```

Here we just removed the file extension. If you are adding a file extension, 
be sure to include the dot `(.)`.

# Pass objects via file stream

In the simple example, we just numbered each spot in the file stream 
object. Passing a single number will create a sequence of that length

```{r}
x <- new_stream(100)
```

Otherwise, we can create a custom sequence

```{r}
x <- new_stream(seq(1, 100, 4))
x[[2]]
```

If we have a large data set, we can chunk that up and pass that in. Illustrating
with a toy example

```{r}
data <- expand.ev(amt = 100, ID = seq(10))
head(data)
```

chunk the data frame into a list

```{r}
chunked <- chunk_by_row(data, nchunk = 5)
```

And then pass that in

```{r}
x <- new_stream(chunked)

length(x)

x[[3]]
```

Now he `x` position has only the "chunk" of data that we need for the current
simulation; this prevents the entire data frame from getting passed to every 
worker. 

# The locker system

There are important things to know about the locker system; this is what really 
makes the arrow data sets work well. 

When you first create a file stream with a `locker` location, you need to 
specify a directory that does not exist; if the directory exists, you'll get 
an error. 

Once you create a locker space, that space is reserved for storing output 
files and should __only__ be used for storing files that are saved using
`write_stream()`. The locker space is marked by a hidden file that tells
`mrgsim.parallel` that this is a locker space

```{r}
x <- new_stream(3, locker = locker)
list.files(locker, all.files = TRUE)
```

Because this is a marked and reserved space, whenever the file stream is
initiated, the locker space is __completely__ cleared of files. That is to say, 
all the files in the locker space will be blown away at the time the file 
stream is created or re-created. To say it another way, `new_stream()` called 
with a locker creates the locker space the first time it is called and 
__completely clears the space__ at any subsequent call with that locker name. 
This is really important to remember that the process renews  / resets at the 
time that `new_stream()` is called; it is equivalent to over writing existing
files except that it happens in two steps: first all existing files are 
removed and then new files are created. Thus, the locker world works mainly
in terms of directories rather than files (although obviously files are also 
involved). 


__WHY?__ The reason for this is to be able to support arrow data sets. Using 
`arrow::open_dataset(lockername)` is a very efficient way to access very large
data stored on disk. In order for this to work, all of the files in the 
directory must be contributing members of that data set. The only way to do this
is to reset the data set space whenever the data set is re-written and that 
happens at the time the file set is created. 


## Safety considerations

Two approached can be taken to secure existing simulations: create a saved "version" or make
the locker not resettable. 

### Versions

To save a version of some simulations, call `version_locker()`

```{r, include = FALSE}
new_locker <- paste0(locker, "-v000")
if(dir.exists(new_locker)) unlink(new_locker, recursive = TRUE)
```


```{r}
y <- version_locker(locker, version = "v000")
```

This creates a new directory named according to the existing locker name, but with a "version"
tag attached, and copies all the locker files to this new directory. So if the locker is named

```{r}
basename(locker)
```

then the version would be named

```{r}
basename(y)
```

See the help topic `?version_locker` for more options around this versioning process. New versions
are not automatically incremented (e.g. "locker-001", "locker-002") by design. The intent behind the 
locker system is to create a re-writable space. Versioning an existing locker is just a
convenient way to stash existing simulations under a similar name. Note that you can also create
a new version at your call to `new_stream()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- new_stream(100, locker = "existing/locker-v2")
```

Going forward, simulations will be saved to "version 2" of a locker location that already exists. 
There is nothing special about this setup; just some creativity in naming output directories.

Caution is advised: the locker system was created to save very large simulation outputs; by continuously 
creating new versions, you could quickly overrun your disk space. This should be used with care. 

### Prevent reset

To prevent the locker from being reset, use `noreset_locker()`; this removes the hidden file
designating the directory as a valid locker space and prevents it from being cleared.

```{r, include = FALSE}
unlink(locker, recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x <- new_stream(5, locker = locker)
x <- new_stream(5, locker = locker)
x <- new_stream(5, locker = locker)
noreset_locker(locker)
cat("foo", file = file.path(locker, 'foo.txt'))
# new_stream(5, locker = locker)
# list.files(locker)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
if(dir.exists(locker)) unlink(locker, recursive = TRUE)
```

If you _really_ want to be safe, you can disable the resetting of the locker
space immediately after creating it

```{r}
x <- new_stream(5, locker = locker)
noreset_locker(locker)
```

The next time you try to reset this particular locker space, you will be denied
and an error will be generated. Only use this option when safety is your 
number one priority; it will be inconvenient because you will always need to 
manually clean up the locker space or generate new locations every time the 
simulations are re-run.
